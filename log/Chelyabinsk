Energy before atmospheric entry: 3.32 x 10^15 Joules  = 793.34 KiloTons TNT

The average interval between impacts of this size somewhere on Earth is 97.3 years.

Major Global Changes:
The Earth is not strongly disturbed by the impact and loses negligible mass.
The impact does not make a noticeable change in the tilt of Earth's axis (< 5 hundreths of a degree).
The impact does not shift the Earth's orbit noticeably.

Atmospheric Entry:
The projectile begins to breakup at an altitude of 52746.996373 meters = 173010.148104 ft
The projectile bursts into a cloud of fragments at an altitude of 28412.279215 meters = 93192.275824 ft
The residual velocity of the projectile fragments after the burst is 14.177812 km/s = 8.804421 miles/s
The energy of the airburst is 1.47 x 10^15 Joules = 0.35 x 10^0 MegaTons.
No crater is formed, although large fragments may strike the surface.

Air Blast:
What does this mean?
The air blast will arrive approximately 86.151127 seconds after impact.
Peak Overpressure:  1651.804870 - 3303.609741 Pa = 0.016518 - 0.033036 bars = 0.234556 - 0.469113 psi
Max wind velocity:  3.866266 m/s = 8.648606 mph
Sound Intensity:  64 dB (Loud as heavy traffic)
Damage Description:  Glass windows may shatter.
