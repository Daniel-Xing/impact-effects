Energy before atmospheric entry: 5.36 x 10^16 Joules  = 1.28 x 10^1 MegaTons TNT

The average interval between impacts of this size somewhere on Earth during the last 4 billion years is 1.2 x 10^3years.

Major Global Changes:
The Earth is not strongly disturbed by the impact and loses negligible mass.
The impact does not make a noticeable change in the tilt of Earth's axis (< 5 hundreths of a degree).
The impact does not shift the Earth's orbit noticeably.

Atmospheric Entry:
The projectile begins to breakup at an altitude of 16745.575481 meters = 54925.487577 ft
The projectile reaches the ground in a broken condition.  The mass of projectile strikes the surface at velocity 9.927755 km/s = 6.165136 miles/s
The energy lost in the atmosphere is 4.04 x 10^16 Joules = 9.65 x 10^0 MegaTons.
The impact energy is 0.00 x 10^-inf Joules = 0.00 x 10^-infMegaTons.
The larger of these two energies is used to estimate the airblast damage.
The broken projectile fragments strike the ground in an ellipse of dimension 0.333143 km by 0.235568 km

Crater Dimensions:
Crater shape is normal in spite of atmospheric crushing fragments are not significantly dispersed.
Transient Crater Diameter:
940.403712 meters ( = 3084.524175 feets )
Transient Crater Depth:  332.533137 meters ( = 1090.708690 feets )
Final Crater Diameter:
1175.504640 meters ( = 3855.655218 feets )
Final Crater Depth:  250.236698 meters ( = 820.776371 feets )
simple crater 
The floor of the crater is underlain by a lens of broken rock debris (breccia) with a maximum thickness of 116.000508 meters ( = 380.481665 feets ).
At this size, the crater forms in its own melt pool.
Thermal Radiation:
What does this mean?
At this impact velocity ( < 15 km/s), little vaporization occurs no fireball is created, therefore, there is no thermal radiation damage.
Seismic Effects:
What does this mean?
The major seismic shaking will arrive approximately 40.000000 seconds after impact.
Richter Scale Magnitude:  4.9

Ejecta:
Most ejecta is blocked by Earth's atmosphere
Air Blast:
What does this mean?
The air blast will arrive approximately 606.060606 seconds after impact.
Peak Overpressure:  597.758842 Pa = 0.005978 bars = 0.084882 psi
Max wind velocity:  1.405407 m/s = 3.143812 mph
Sound Intensity:  56 dB (Loud as heavy traffic)
