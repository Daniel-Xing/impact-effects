Energy before atmospheric entry: 6.11 x 10^16 Joules  = 1.46 x 10^1 MegaTons TNT

The average interval between impacts of this size somewhere on Earth during the last 4 billion years is 1.3 x 10^3years.

Major Global Changes:
The Earth is not strongly disturbed by the impact and loses negligible mass.
The impact does not make a noticeable change in the tilt of Earth's axis (< 5 hundreths of a degree).
The impact does not shift the Earth's orbit noticeably.

Atmospheric Entry:
The projectile begins to breakup at an altitude of m meters = 196392.616948 ft
The projectile bursts into a cloud of fragments at an altitude of 5736.517750 meters = 18815.778221 ft
The residual velocity of the projectile fragments after the burst is 5.728477 km/s = 3.557384 miles/s
The energy of the airburst is 5.61 x 10^16 Joules = 1.34 x 10^1 MegaTons.
No crater is formed, although large fragments may strike the surface.

Air Blast:
What does this mean?
The air blast will arrive approximately 48.665161 seconds after impact.
Peak Overpressure:  38666.688086 - 77333.376173 Pa = 0.386667 - 0.773334 bars = 5.490670 - 10.981339 psi
Max wind velocity:  78.988508 m/s = 176.692554 mph
Sound Intensity:  92 dB (May cause ear pain)
Damage Description:  Multistory wall-bearing             buildings will experience             severe cracking and interior                 partitions will be blown down
 Wood frame buildings will almost completely collapse.
 Glass windows will shatter.
 Up to 90 percent of trees blown down             remainder stripped of branches and leaves.
