Energy before atmospheric entry: 1.65 x 10^24 Joules  = 3.94 x 10^8 MegaTons TNT

The average interval between impacts of this size somewhere on Earth during the last 4 billion years is 4.6 x 10^8years.

Major Global Changes:
The Earth is not strongly disturbed by the impact and loses negligible mass.
The impact does not make a noticeable change in the tilt of Earth's axis (< 5 hundreths of a degree).
Depending on the direction and location of impact, the collision may cause a change in the length of the day of up to 0.006438 unit.
The impact does not shift the Earth's orbit noticeably.

Crater Dimensions:
The crater opened in the water has a diameter of 178400.202480 meters ( = 585152.664135 feets ).
For the crater formed in the seafloor:
Transient Crater Diameter:
108288.732919 meters ( = 355187.043976 feets )
Transient Crater Depth:  38291.631160 meters ( = 125596.550204 feets )
Final Crater Diameter:
200260.576485 meters ( = 656854.690870 feets )
Final Crater Depth:  1458.753658 meters ( = 4784.711999 feets )
complex crater .
The volume of the target melted or vaporized is 12311.438150 km^3 = 2953.514012 miles^3
Roughly half the melt remains in the crater
, where its average thickness is 1336.756677 meters ( = 4384.561901 feets ). 

At this size, the crater forms in its own melt pool.
Thermal Radiation:
What does this mean?
Time for maximum radiation:  11.815296 seconds  after impact
Your position is inside the fireball.
The fireball appears 264.885298 times larger than the sun
Thermal Exposure:  1.93 x 10^10 Joules/m^2
Duration of Irradiation:  3069.969339 seconds
Radiant flux (relative to the sun):  %f 6299.38802339064

Seismic Effects:
What does this mean?
The major seismic shaking will arrive approximately 40.000000 seconds after impact.
Richter Scale Magnitude:  10.3
 (This is greater than any earthquake in recorded history)

Ejecta:
Your position is beneath the continuous ejecta deposit.
Average Ejecta Thickness:  153.470560 meters ( = 503.383438 feet ) 

Mean Fragment Diameter:  0.220325 meters ( = 0.722667 feet ) 


Air Blast:
What does this mean?
The air blast will arrive approximately 606.060606 seconds after impact.
Peak Overpressure:  13108298.758289 Pa = 131.082988 bars = 1861.378424 psi
Max wind velocity:  2902.073165 m/s = 6491.763547 mph
Sound Intensity:  142 dB (Dangerously Loud)
Damage Description: Multistory wall-bearing buildings will collapse.
 Wood frame buildings will almost completely collapse.
 Multistory steel-framed office-type             buildings will suffer extreme frame                 distortion, incipient collapse.
 Highway truss bridges will collapse.
 Highway girder bridges will collapse.
 Glass windows will shatter.
 Cars and trucks will be largely displaced             and grossly distorted and will require rebuilding before use.
 Up to 90 percent of trees blown down             remainder stripped of branches and leaves.


Tsunami Wave:
What does this mean?
The impact-generated tsunami wave arrives approximately 2857.2 seconds after impact. 
Tsunami wave amplitude is between:  223.0 meters ( = 731.4 feets) and 446.0 meters ( = 1462.9 feets).
