Energy before atmospheric entry: 9.54 x 10^20 Joules  = 2.28 x 10^5 MegaTons TNT

The average interval between impacts of this size somewhere on Earth during the last 4 billion years is 1.5 x 10^6years.

Major Global Changes:
The Earth is not strongly disturbed by the impact and loses negligible mass.
The impact does not make a noticeable change in the tilt of Earth's axis (< 5 hundreths of a degree).
The impact does not shift the Earth's orbit noticeably.

Crater Dimensions:
Transient Crater Diameter:
12953.131011 meters ( = 42486.269716 feets )
Transient Crater Depth:  4580.315068 meters ( = 15023.433421 feets )
Final Crater Diameter:
18176.063916 meters ( = 59617.489643 feets )
Final Crater Depth:  708.453216 meters ( = 2323.726549 feets )
complex crater .
The volume of the target melted or vaporized is 4.188565 km^3 = 1.004837 miles^3
Roughly half the melt remains in the crater
, where its average thickness is 31.785264 meters ( = 104.255667 feets ). 

At this size, the crater forms in its own melt pool.
Thermal Radiation:
What does this mean?
Time for maximum radiation:  0.986769 seconds  after impact
Visible fireball radius:  16460.946494 meters ( = 53991.904500 feet ) 
The fireball appears 18.705621 times larger than the sun
Thermal Exposure:  8.95 x 10^6 Joules/m^2
Duration of Irradiation:  254.711404 seconds
Radiant flux (relative to the sun):  %f 35.15296646846637

Seismic Effects:
What does this mean?
The major seismic shaking will arrive approximately 40.000000 seconds after impact.
Richter Scale Magnitude:  8.2

Ejecta:
Most ejecta is blocked by Earth's atmosphere
Air Blast:
What does this mean?
The air blast will arrive approximately 606.060606 seconds after impact.
Peak Overpressure:  58643.603861 Pa = 0.586436 bars = 8.327392 psi
Max wind velocity:  112.765505 m/s = 252.249670 mph
Sound Intensity:  95 dB (May cause ear pain)
Damage Description: Multistory wall-bearing buildings will collapse.
 Wood frame buildings will almost completely collapse.
 Glass windows will shatter.
 Up to 90 percent of trees blown down             remainder stripped of branches and leaves.
